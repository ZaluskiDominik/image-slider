<h1> Description </h1>
Image slider with advanced image transition, made with pure javascript using canvas element

<h1> How to run? </h1>
Clone the repository and move folder to server's root directory. Then you can launch it. Server is required because without it when running
index.html locally by file:// cross origin security exception is triggered(never mind that images are server from local machine) and canvas becomes "tainted", which stops script execution.<br/>
